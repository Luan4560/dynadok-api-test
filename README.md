npm run build : runs the TypeScript typechecker and outputs the compiled JavaScript files.

npm run type-check: runs the TypeScript typechecker, without any file output.

npm run lint: runs ESLint throughout all your files and shows which files have yet to be linted.

npm run format:check: runs Prettier throughout all your files and shows which files have yet to be formatted.
